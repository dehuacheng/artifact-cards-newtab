## Artifact Cards for New Tab in Simplified Chinese

This is forked from https://github.com/redphx/artifact-cards-newtab, and I only changed the display language (since it is hard-coded) to simplifed Chinese.

The Chrome extension can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/artifact-cards-for-new-ta/geleeabpcnglclmilanopackljmpkbhd).
